        <p>This site intends to present information about the products/projects in our Organization.</p>
        <p>The information is obtained from Jenkins/SonarCube and other tools used by the builds and centralized
            in an easy to read format.</p>

                The builds are grouped per product. The site currently contains the following groups:

                <li>The Dashboard is not yet developed ... haven't decided what will go in here.</li>
                <li>The versions of the projects are currently coming from a configuration file. The intention was to
                    get the version from the project dynamically but I didn't find a way to do so.</li>
